		<h1>BPM Music Matcher</h1>
		<h2>Personal Information</h2>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong> Chris Grimley</p> 
		<p><strong>Student number:</strong> 3912799</P> 
		<p><strong>Student email address:</strong> s3912799@student.rmit.edu.au</p> 
		<p><strong>picture:</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Nationality:</strong> Australia</p>
		<p><strong>Education:</strong> Certificate 3 in Information and Technology</p>
		<p><strong>Language:</strong> English</p>
		<p><strong>Interesting fact:</strong> I like sc-fi horror movies</p>
		
		<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
		<p>My interest in IT came as a bit of a blessing in disguise. Growing up I was more of an outside kid and never really 
		played around much with tech. Upon going into the workforce though, a coworker convinced me to buy and build a gaming PC. 
		That then lead to me learning about IT related hardware and software and has also given me a never-ending number of 
		problems that I have had to find solutions to; sparking my interest in IT which has led me here. </p>
		<p>I decided to study at RMIT because they have the option to do this degree online, which has given me a lot more 
		flexibility and they seem like a reputable University.</p>
		<p>I expect that I will learn and develop several skills during my studies at RMIT. These skills can range from computer 
		programming, web and mobile computing, business and communication skills, cybersecurity, software deployment and artificial 
		intelligence, among other things. These skills that I develop will allow me to gain a job in IT organizations ranging from 
		schools, business, healthcare, government, etc. </p>
		
		<h2>Ideal Job:</h2>
		<img src="JobDescription.png" alt="a junior software engineer position at globalx">
		<p>A junior software engineer for the company GlobalX. The duty of this role will include full stack engineering, 
		programming, working in a team environment and continual learning in the field. It would be a good role to start 
		in after graduating to gain experience as a software engineer. </p>
		<p>The role requires a bachelor's and/or Master's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related 
		technical discipline. The job role requires that the person has solid engineering and object-oriented programing 
		skills, someone who loves to learn and code, and works well in a team environment. </p>
		<p>Atm I only have a certificate 3 in IT, as this role requires a bachelor's and/or Master's degree in Computer 
		Science, Computer Engineering or a related technical discipline. I would first have to finish my bachelor's degree. 
		I would also have to taper my degree so that it would include subjects that are covered in this field. These subjects would 
		include classes like software development, programming and engineering related classes. </p>
		
		<h2>Profile</h2>
		<p>Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as Defenders. Known for their reliability and altruism, Defenders are 
		good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Defenders’ dedication is 
		invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth. Yet Defenders can be easily tripped up in areas where their kindness 
		and practical approach are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, learning to relax or 
		improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, Defenders need to put in a conscious effort 
		to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>
		<img src="LearningStyles.png" alt= "the results of the learning styles inventory">
		<img src="ThebigFive.png" alt= "the results of the the big five personality types">
		<p>The results of the test reiterate to me my most prominent personality types, such as being very logical, observant, open to 
		innovative ideas and extraverted, and give me knowledge of more subtle areas of my personality which is beneficial to know about to 
		make improvements and be aware of.</p>
		<p>I can see the results of these tests would influence my behavior in a team as I would be able to work both autonomously and in a 
		team. I would be able to communicate my ideas but also be open to hearing other peoples and working together to find a solution. I 
		would be dependable to do my portion of the work and would be considering the wellbeing of the people I am working with.</p>
		<p>When forming a team, I am able to choose people who differ in personalities but not so much that there would be conflict or an 
		inability to agree and get the job done due to a difference in learning styles. I can choose people who are better suited to working 
		physically, are open to innovative ideas and like having concrete results, but as an example, have better verbal skills or perfectionistic 
		qualities to complement one another and achieve a better overall result. </p>
		
		<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
		<p>A beats per minute (BMP) music matching prototype APP that matches an input in which will be avg BPM with a music tempo or BMP. The input 
		will collect and be categorized into a number set range of BPM for example 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, going up to 200 in which it will then correspond 
		to a song that falls into that range of BPM. The goal then would be to further develop the prototype in which one could collect input with a device 
		such as a heart rate (HR) watch or chest strap monitor and match it with music that falls into that range. </p>
		<p>This app would be great for people who are into exercising or need something to give them more motivation when they are doing their training. 
		“Studies have shown that listening to high-tempo music increases the benefits of exercise for physical fitness and reduces the perceived effort involved” (Hastings 2020, para. 2). 
		Currently Spotify has a tool called Simply Spotify Running. This tool uses your phone sensors to detect your steps per minute and match music to that running tempo. 
		Users find the app advantageous but feel like it there is room for improvement (Mitroff 2015).  I think tracking something like BPM would be helpful in improving this function.</p>
		<p>The app will focus on the development of the protype first in which will be done using a programming platform or an app developing platform. The logical part of the app will be made up 
		of a library, input collection, data analyzing and output. The library will store songs into their respected BPM categories. The songs will be categorized into sets of 10, for example 50-60, 60-70, 70-80BMP etc. going up to 200BPM.  
		There are already BMP song analysis tools that could be used to collect the BPM of the songs, these include tools such as songbpm (SongBPM 2021). and GetSongbpm (GetSongbpm 2020).The input for the prototype will be from a keyboard, 
		by tapping your space bar to get avg BMP. This will then be paired with a matching song in that range. After the prototype is developed the goal would be to look at pairing it with HR monitors such as a HR monitoring watch or chest 
		monitoring strap that has its own BPM analyzer. This would require more research, and working with other companies possibly, to make the platforms compatible.  The Data analyzing component will first store the current BPM and set 
		it in its respective range. The range is set in sets of 10 to give the music a bit of a buffer and range to work in, otherwise the music would undergo change too quickly and make it too hard for the user to hold a BPM intensity 
		of +-1s. This may require tweaking along the way and the buffer may need to be tweaked. The output will play the matching song on an audio output device such as headphones or speakers and will undergo change when the intensity of the BMP changes.</p>
		<p>I think the goal would support both Android and IOS mobile devices. This would require looking at low-level coding. To develop code for the prototype, using low-level code to support IOS 
		I could use Swift and for Android I could use Java. This would allow the prototype to be more customizable, but would require a higher level of skill for to development of the app. I could 
		however create a hybrid code using leagues such as Cordova or React Native which would be compatible with both Andriod and IOS. This however might affect the customization of the app (buildfire n.d.). </p>
		<p>If the prototype is successful, the goal would be further development and making it compatible with current technologies such a HR monitoring devices and music apps such as Spotify or apple music. 
		The prototype could also be sold to anyone of the companies as well. This app would further increase the accuracy of matching a songs BPMs with ones current input of BPMs. The effect of this could help 
		motivate and push someone harder in their fitness training. </p>
